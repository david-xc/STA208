In the folder, the training steps of EfficientNet and the performance on testset are given seperately in several jupyter notebooks. 

	* `Training of EfficientNet.ipynb`: this is the notebook for the training of the EfficientNet.
    
	* `Performance_EfficientNet_Unbalanced.ipynb`: this notebook presents the performance of the EfficientNet trained with the unbalanced data.
  
  * `Performance_EfficientNet_balanced.ipynb`: this notebook presents the performance of the EfficientNet trained with the balanced data.
  
## How to run the code

You can frist run "Training of EfficientNet.ipynb" for training. Then by running "Performance_EfficientNet_Unbalanced.ipynb" and "Performance_EfficientNet_balanced.ipynb", you can see the performances of the EfficientNet trained with balanced and unbalanced dataset respectively.
